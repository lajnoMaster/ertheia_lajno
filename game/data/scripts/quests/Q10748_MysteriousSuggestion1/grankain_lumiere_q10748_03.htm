You have been invited to the Ceremony of Chaos. Once at the arena, you will be able to prove your worth.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">If you participate twice and bring back 2 Tournament Remnants</font>, I'll give you a small gift.<br>
Only 1 gift per day, however! <font color="LEVEL">Remain in the arena until the match ends in order to receive the Remnant.</font><br>
Good luck!
