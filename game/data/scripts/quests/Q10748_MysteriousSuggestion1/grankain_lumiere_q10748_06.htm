Still here, eh? And still no Tournament Remnants, I see. Remember: every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday from 8 p.m. to 12 a.m., you will receive an invitation to the Ceremony of Chaos from the Mysterious Mansion every 15 minutes. If you participate twice, you will receive 2 Tournament Remnants.<br>
You must remain in the arena until the match ends in order to receive them!
