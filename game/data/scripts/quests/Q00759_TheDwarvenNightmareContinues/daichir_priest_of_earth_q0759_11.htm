Now, we cannot just send in whoever wants to go. We must limit the numbers to allow for smooth logistics and some space to swing your weapons.<br>
We have decided that the optimal size would be a group of no more than <font color="LEVEL">200 of the strongest adventurers (Lv. 98 or above)</font>. Of course, we expect nothing less of these warriors than <font color="LEVEL">the elimination of Trasken's main body</font>.
