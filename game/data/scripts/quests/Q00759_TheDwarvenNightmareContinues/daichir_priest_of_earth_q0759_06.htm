Now, we first need to consider group size. We could send millions in, but logistics would become impossible to coordinate and you'd have no space to swing your weapons.<br>
We've decided to limit group size to <font color="LEVEL">200 of the strongest adventurers (level 98 or above)</font>. You can only attempt to eliminate Trasken when you have met these requirements. And, obviously, the mission will only be deemed complete when <font color="LEVEL">the main Trasken body is killed</font>.<br>
