The <font color="LEVEL">Magma Ore</font>. I just knew it. If I used Magma Ores, I would be able to withstand the heat. We started training to collect Magma Ores.<br>
We fought many monsters, and collected Magma Ores. Of course, it wasn't easy. The monsters branded us with the <font color="LEVEL">Flaming Stigma</font>, and that led to countless monsters attacking us at once.<br>
In the end, the others just quit. I didn't. I'm here to find people who will help me collect Magma Ores. Only those who are skilled will be able to do it. How about collecting some Magma Ores if you think you've got what it takes?<br>
