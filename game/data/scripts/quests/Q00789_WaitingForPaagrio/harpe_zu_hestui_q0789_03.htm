<html><body>Harp Zu Hestui:<br>
I'm Harp Zu Hestui. I'm awaiting for the arrival of Flame Lord Pa'agrio, who will revive the Hestui clan.<br>
There are those who talk behind my back, but they just don't understand my grand dream.<br>
After the Blazing Swamp was engulfed in greater flames than before, I came here in order to train in preparation for Pa'agrio's arrival.<br>
At first, a lot of people followed me, but they couldn't withstand the training and left.<br>
