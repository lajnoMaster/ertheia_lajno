The Magma Ores you brought will be used to prepare for Pa'agrio's arrival. This is not perfect, but it's still great.<br>
I'll give you the reward I promised. In the name of Pa'agrio, I will remember your help. We still need to make more preparations, so if you are willing to help again, come back tomorrow.
