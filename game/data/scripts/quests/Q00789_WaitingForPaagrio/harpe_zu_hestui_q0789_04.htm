The training?<br>
I came here after the volcano here erupted. I thought that maybe Flame Lord Pa'agrio was headed to the Blazing Swamp.<br>
That's when I found all these monsters. How can they not be affected by the hot lava?<br>
It was just out of curiosity. I thought that if I could withstand the hot flames like them, I would be able to help Pa'agrio. I started observing them closer.<br>
