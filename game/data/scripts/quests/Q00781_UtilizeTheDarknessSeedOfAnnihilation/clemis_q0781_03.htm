It's simple, really. There's a thing called <font color="LEVEL">Soul Stone Fragments</font>. They're Special Products, meaning they're not easy to find. So you collect something more common, and trade them in for these.<br>
You can then exchange the Soul Stone Fragments for useful stuff through Special Product Broker Kirklan at the Keucereus Alliance Base. It will be good for you.<br>
